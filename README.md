# Buddhabrot - a ghostly probability distribution related to the Mandelbrot stet

![Buddhabrot False-colour](./examples/FalseColour.jpeg)

The Buddhabrot is a beautiful fractal shape, generated through similar iterations to Mandelbrot set images.
To generate your own image, you can run `scripts/utils.py`. 

Note that the scripts in utils will look for an existing tally of points with the specified resolution and iterlimit, and will add on any new points to that tally if it exists. Otherwise it will start from a zero-matrix.
