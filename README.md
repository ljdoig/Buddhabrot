# Buddhabrot - a ghostly probability distribution related to the Mandelbrot stet

The Buddhabrot is a beautiful fractal shape, generated through similar iterations to Mandelbrot set images. A brief description can be found below and more details can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot.

Buddhabrot visualises a probability distribution. We start by paritioning the complex plane into bins. ComplexÂ numbers are sampled uniformly from a circular region around the origin of the complex plane, then iterated according to the same rule as the Mandelbrot set: Z(n) = Z(n-1)^2 + c, where c is the sampled point and Z(0) = 0. If the point remains close to the origin after a predefined number of iterations k, we discard the sample, however if the point diverges then we increment each bin associated with a point in {Z(0),...,Z(k)}. By sampling many points this gives us a tally accross all the bins and then normalising these bin frequencies to values between 0 and 1, we can turn this into a greyscale image. Further, by creating 3 different tallies with a different number of iterations, we can create a false colour image whose colours come from the 3 tallies (one for red, green and blue, giving an RGB pixel).

To generate your own images, you can run `scripts/utils.py`, which will generate one greyscale image and one colour image. Note that this script will look for existing tallies in `./csvs` with the specified resolution and iterlimit. The number of new points specified will then be sampled and either added to an existing tally (if it exists) or to a zero-matrix.
